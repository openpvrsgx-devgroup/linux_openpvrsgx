- The files in etc/udevudev-rules should be copied to
     /etc/udev/rules.d
  this will ensure stable names in /dev for input devices and
  the ttys that talk to the 3G modem.

- Kernel can be compiled using a cross compiler.  I use
    angstrom-2011.03-x86_64-linux-armv7a-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2
  from  http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/toolchains/

  This goes in /usr/local/angstom.
  I then compile with

   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/angstrom/arm/bin
   export CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/angstrom/arm/bin/arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi-
   mkdir O
   make O=O gta04_defconfig
   make O=O -j8 uImage
   rm -r M; mkdir M
   cp O/arch/arm/book/uImage M
   make O=O INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=`pwd`/M modules_install


  then the uImage and modules are in 'M' ready to be copied


- Directory 'root' includes some sample scripts to various
  simple tasks

  + b_host.sh helps to switch to b_host otg state (GTA04 is external
    powered but plays the role of an usb host, the id pin is
    not grounded in that situation). First apply power or switch on
    software-controlled charging, run that script, then also connect
    the usb data lines
